Android Alarm Application with Service and BroadcastReceiver
This project is an Android application that demonstrates how to set, run, and cancel a one-time alarm using core Android components like Service, BroadcastReceiver, and AlarmManager.

  AIM
To create an Android application that allows a user to set a specific time for an alarm. When the alarm time is reached, a background Service is started, which plays an alarm sound. The user also has the ability to cancel a set alarm, which stops the sound if it's playing and prevents it from ringing in the future.

Features
Set Alarm: Users can click a "Create" button to open a TimePickerDialog and select a time for the alarm.
Display Set Time: Once an alarm is set, its time is displayed on a dedicated card, which becomes visible.
Alarm Notification: At the exact time set by the user, an alarm sound starts playing.
Cancel Alarm: Users can cancel the scheduled alarm. If the alarm is already ringing, it will stop.
Persistent Alarm Scheduling: The app requests the necessary SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM permission to ensure reliability on modern Android versions.
UI with Material Design: The user interface is built using Material Components like MaterialCardView and MaterialButton.

Core Concepts Demonstrated
This project provides a practical study of several fundamental Android concepts:

Service: A background component used here as AlarmService to play the alarm sound independently of the app's UI. It uses MediaPlayer to manage the audio.
BroadcastReceiver: AlarmBroadcastReceiver listens for the alarm trigger from AlarmManager. It then starts the AlarmService to play the sound.
AlarmManager: The core Android class used to schedule and cancel time-based alarms that operate outside the lifecycle of the application. The project uses setExact() to ensure the alarm fires at the precise time.
PendingIntent: Wraps an Intent to be fired by AlarmManager at a later time, granting it permission to execute the BroadcastReceiver on the app's behalf.
TimePickerDialog: A standard dialog for a user-friendly time selection experience.
Calendar & SimpleDateFormat: Used to manage and format date and time information for setting the alarm and displaying it to the user.
MediaPlayer: Used within the AlarmService to play the raw alarm sound resource.
Permissions: The app properly declares <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/> in the manifest and directs the user to system settings if the permission is not granted.
Activity Lifecycle & UI Management: Demonstrates managing UI visibility (View.GONE, View.VISIBLE) based on application state (e.g., showing the alarm card only when an alarm is set).
Project Structure
MainActivity.kt: The main UI controller. It handles user interactions for creating and canceling alarms, displaying the TimePickerDialog, and communicating with the AlarmManager.
AlarmService.kt: A Service class that manages the MediaPlayer to play and stop the alarm sound. It is designed to be started and stopped by intents.
AlarmBroadcastReceiver.kt: A BroadcastReceiver that acts as the entry point for the AlarmManager. When triggered, it starts the AlarmService.
activity_main.xml: The XML layout file for the main screen, defining the UI elements using ConstraintLayout and MaterialCardView.
AndroidManifest.xml: Declares all application components (Activity, Service, Receiver) and required permissions.
res/raw/alarm.mp3: The audio file that is played when the alarm goes off (you should have this file in your res/raw directory).
